The first one I used is matter.js, but I learned that they don't have continuous collision detection, so when setting the mass of the larger block to 1000kg, the inner mass goes so fast that the engine no longer detects its collisions, and the block just dissapears... I tried again with planck.js, which is a port of box2d and features ccd, however I get a similar problem, where the inner block goes so fast and begins to clip into the larger block at around 1000kg, throwing off the computation."
